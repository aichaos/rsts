  # The tests themselves are broken into a series of "Test Actions": it's an
  # array of tasks to be processed from top to bottom, and each action can
  # stream RiveScript source code (additive), test inputs and outputs and
  # manage user variables. See "Test Actions" below for more details.
  tests:
    # Stream in RiveScript source code to test against. Most tests will start with
    # one of these, and some tests may have multiple source statements that should
    # be streamed over top of the existing brain.

        // literal-style multi-line string.
        + hello bot
        - Hello human!

        + how are you
        - Good, you?
        - Alright, how are you?

        + my name is *
        - <set name=<formal>>Nice to meet you, <get name>.

        + who am i
        - Your name is <get name>, right?

    # A simple input and output
    - input: "Hello bot!"
      reply: "Hello human!"

    # You can test random outputs too, just use an array for the 'reply'
    - input: "How are you?"
      reply:
        - Good, you?
        - Alright, how are you?

    # Testing setting a user variable...
    - input: "My name is Alice"
      reply: "Nice to meet you, Alice."

    # ...and verify it was set
    - input: "Who am I?"
      reply: "Your name is Alice, right?"

    # ...by asserting the user variable is correct.
    - assert:
        name: "Alice"

    # Or you can set the user variable directly:
    - set:
        name: "Bob"

    # And verify:
    - assert:
        name: "Bob"

    # Another way to verify:
    - input: "Who am I?"
      reply: "Your name is Bob, right?"

    # And if you need to stream in additional code:
    - source: |
        + what is your name
        - I'm just a RiveScript bot.

    - input: "What is your name?"
      reply: "I'm just a RiveScript bot."
